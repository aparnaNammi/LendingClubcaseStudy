## General Information
- Risk analytics in banking and financial services and understanding how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company or
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Conclusions
- Several driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables that are strong indicators of default are identified. such as
- Interest Rate: Higher interest rates are likely associated with higher default risks.
- Revolving Utilization: Indicates a borrower’s credit utilization, which may signal financial stress.
- Debt to Income Ratio: Borrowers with high DTI may be at greater risk of default.
- Loan Amount: Larger loans could indicate higher risk
- Grades: Lower grades (e.g., F, G) likely have higher default rates.
- Home ownership: Renters have slightly higher default rates than those with mortgages or owned homes.
- Verification: Loans with full verification show higher default rates, potentially reflecting higher-risk loans requiring additional scrutiny.
- Loan Term: Longer loan terms carry substantially greater default risk.
